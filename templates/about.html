        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>I am an avid learner of all things relating to technology and online business. My previous experience working
            with research and tech companies has taught me how important a fun and easy-to-use product can be for the
            customer
            and client alike.</p>

        <p>Growing up, I always had a passion for technology. I was always the kid that had my head in my gameboy or
            behind
            a computer screen of some sort. I had spent many years during middle school and high school learning from
            and
            helping friends and family set up their computers, hardware issues, virus removal, backing up information,
            setting
            up routers, and assist with building and upgrading computers. </p>

        <p>After a while, I decided that I would start learning how to create my own software. I had done a project in
            high
            school called “Career Cruising” where we would research future career paths and found that I had a deep
            interest
            in programming.</p>

        <p>My first dive into learning how to code was learning the BASIC programming language. I had found Liberty
            BASIC
            and began to learn the fundamentals of programming through there. I fell in love with the idea of developing
            for the web and the scope of what is possible through the web browser so I had started learning HTML, CSS,
            and
            Javascript but didn’t really get very far into the latter until some years later.</p>

        <p>After high school, I put development on hold because I had decided that I would focus full-time on my musical
            endeavors, joined a few bands, put out an album, and decided that I would finally come back to coding which
            led
            me to where I am now. Within the past year and a half, I restarted my learning journey with online tutorials
            through Udemy and Lynda
            before joining an intensive coding bootcamp to get my skills to the next level.</p>

        <p>Between October of 2018 and September of 2019 I worked as a full-stack web and mobile application developer
            for a small consultancy
            called Kyros Digital based in Grand Rapids, MI working with React,
            React Native, Meteor, SASS, and whatever technologies that came to mind!</p>

            <p>By the end of 2019, I had met up with an old friend of mine that I had met in high school who had served in the army for some years. 
                He was seeking to start a new company in the digital games space. I had joined him as a programmer and then as a managing partner for the company.
                I had mostly specialized in smaller games as shown in the work section displayed on here, but we decided we would try our hands at producing high-quality games that are respected by many.
            </p>

        <p class="lfw">I am also a freelancer in my spare time, looking to take on new projects or join an exciting
            team building web, mobile, and gaming applications</p>
